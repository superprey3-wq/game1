![Moonfang Castle — the cathedral nave](docs/screenshot.png)

> A gothic action‑platformer roguelite. Explore **one great, procedurally‑built castle**, master a deep arsenal, and bring down its guardians to earn the traversal powers that open the way deeper in. Written from scratch in **vanilla JavaScript** on a single `<canvas>` — no engine, no framework, no runtime dependencies.

Think *Castlevania: Circle of the Moon* by way of a roguelite: a Metroidvania‑gated castle that regenerates every run, an arcana card system, weapon tempering and crafting, relics, mining, and a nine‑stage campaign that ends at **The Moonfang**.

---

## ✨ Features

**The castle**
- **19 themed zones** raised end‑to‑end into one continuous castle — outer wall, cemetery, cathedral, belfry, catacombs, cistern, clock ruin, foundry, keep, gallery, spire, observatory, abyss, and the lunar heart — each with its own biome, backdrop, staging, hazards, and hand‑authored **room grammars**.
- **Procedural generation** with authored structure: rooms are built in four beats (*kishōtenketsu*), towers/shafts/lifts stitch the elevations together, and a battery of `finishWorld` passes guarantee the whole thing is **walkable** (spine carve, trap‑escape, connector re‑opening, no one‑way pits).
- A **2D fog‑of‑war map** with named regions, player‑placed marks, and Castlevania‑style **scene cuts** as you cross room edges.
- **Sealed chambers, sky islands, warp obelisks, forges, shrines, and a wandering merchant** hidden throughout.

**The hunt**
- **30 main weapons** and **19 sub‑weapons** — whip, sword, axe, spear, claws, scythe, censer, glaive, and more — every one forgeable, each with its own reach, swing arc, and on‑hit effects.
- **53 skills** across three trees, **24 perks** (×4 ranks), timed **buffs**, and generated **relics** with rarity tiers and set bonuses.
- **A 4 × 13 arcana card system** (~50 pairings), **194 crafting recipes**, **mining** across 11 materials, and per‑weapon **mastery**.
- **Boss guardians** that each grant a traversal power — *wings, gallop, maw, tide, ember, mist* — which unlock the warded gates gating the castle (the Metroidvania loop).
- A finishable **9‑stage campaign** to the three‑phase final boss, plus **boss rush**, a **daily seed**, and endless play.
- **100+ bestiary forms** (11 elemental variants × species), **36 persistent deeds**, lore tablets, and meta‑unlocks — all saved to `localStorage`.

**Play anywhere**
- Runs in any modern browser, wraps as a **desktop app** via Electron, and ships with **on‑screen touch controls** for phones and tablets.
- Full **keyboard** and **gamepad** support.

## 🎮 Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Gamepad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | Arrow keys / `WASD` | D‑pad / left stick |
| Jump | `X` · `K` · `Space` | A |

On the title screen: `R` continue last run · `Y` daily seed · `B` boss rush · `N` bestiary · `F` feats.
`M` toggles music, `[` / `]` adjust volume, `F3` shows the debug overlay.

## 📱 Play on mobile

> 🚧 **Work in progress.** Mobile touch controls are functional but still being polished — expect rough edges.

Open the site on a phone in **landscape** and an on‑screen overlay appears automatically: a d‑pad on the left, `JMP` / `ATK` / `DSH` / `SUB` on the right, and a translucent utility row (start/pause, arcana, item crash, satchel, map). The controls only show on touch devices — append `?touch=1` to any URL to preview them on a desktop, or `?touch=0` to force them off.

---

## 🚀 Running it

The game is **plain static files** — `index.html` loads the scripts in `js/` and the art in `assets/`. There is no build step to play it.

```bash
# Play in a browser — serve the folder and open it
npx serve .            # or:  python3 -m http.server 8000
# → http://localhost:8000
```

```bash
# Desktop app (Electron)
npm install
npm start              # sandboxed Linux? use:  npm start -- --no-sandbox
```

```bash
# Build the desktop app  →  dist/*.AppImage + dist/*.tar.gz
npm run dist

# Build the trimmed static bundle for web hosting  →  web-dist/
npm run build:web

# Build + deploy web-dist/ to Cloudflare Pages (needs `wrangler login` first)
npm run deploy
```

**Host it online for free.** Because it's static, `web-dist/` (or the repo root) drops straight onto **Cloudflare Pages**, **GitHub Pages**, or **Netlify** — no server required. Each player's progress lives in their own browser's `localStorage`.

## 🧪 Development & QA

There is no browser required to validate changes — the project ships with headless harnesses that run on a software canvas:

```bash
node tools/smoke.js        # simulated playthroughs across every game state
node tools/audit.js        # structural QA — proves the castle is built & walkable
node tools/design.js       # design audit — pacing, difficulty curve, risk vs reward
node tools/render.js out/  # render real PNG frames of every zone, boss, and menu
```

`tools/render.js` is how the screenshots in this README were produced.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome — **especially new levels**. The castle is data‑driven, so most of a level lives in a couple of registries rather than in engine code.

**Add a new level as its own branch:**

1. Branch off `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b level/<your-level-name>
   ```
2. Define the level as a **zone**. Each zone is an entry in `ZONES` (`js/config.js`) — its biome, floor row, the pool of rooms it draws from, a danger rating, and any boss / reward / gate — plus a **room‑grammar** builder in `js/level.js` (see `segNave`, `segCrypt`, `segFoundry`, … each wrapped by `withRegion`). A brand‑new biome also needs a `BACKDROP` and `STAGING` entry.
3. Prove it builds and is walkable before you push:
   ```bash
   node tools/audit.js         # structural QA — floating props, sealed rooms, unwalkable spine
   node tools/design.js        # pacing, difficulty curve, reward vs risk
   node tools/smoke.js         # full-playthrough smoke test
   node tools/render.js out/   # render frames and eyeball them
   ```
4. Push your branch and open a pull request.

Keeping each level on its **own branch** lets them be reviewed, iterated, and merged independently — you can try a level without ever touching `master`.
